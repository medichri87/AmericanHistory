</h3>
<p class = "p_info"> Roosevelt's terms as president were marked by bold moves to fight two of the largest threats to America and the world: the Great Depression and World War II. His aggressive and unprecedented New Deal programs left a lasting mark on the American landscape. The federal government grew stronger and became deeply involved in programs traditionally reserved for the states. Further, FDR's leadership throughout World War II led to victory for the Allies even though Roosevelt died before the war ended.</p>
