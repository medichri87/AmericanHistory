<h2 class="header">Early Life (1732–1753)</h2>

<p>George Washington (February 22, 1732 – December 14, 1799) was one of the Founding Fathers of the United States, serving as the commander-in-chief of the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War. He also presided over the convention that drafted the Constitution, which replaced the Articles of Confederation. The Constitution established the position of President of the United States, which Washington was the first to hold.</p>

<p>Washington was elected President as the unanimous choice of the 69 electors 
in 1788, and he served two terms in office. He oversaw the creation of a strong, 
well-financed national government that maintained neutrality in the wars raging 
in Europe, suppressed rebellion, and won acceptance among Americans of all 
types. His leadership style established many forms and rituals of government 
that have been used since, such as using a cabinet system and delivering an 
inaugural address. Further, the peaceful transition from his presidency to the 
presidency of John Adams established a tradition that continues into the 21st 
century. Historically, Washington has been widely regarded as the "father of his 
country".</p>

<p>Washington was born into the provincial gentry of Colonial Virginia; his wealthy planter family owned tobacco plantations and slaves. After both his father and older brother died when he was young, Washington became personally and professionally attached to the powerful William Fairfax, who promoted his career as a surveyor and soldier. Washington quickly became a senior officer in the colonial forces during the first stages of the French and Indian War. Chosen by the Second Continental Congress in 1775 to be commander-in-chief of the Continental Army in the American Revolution, Washington managed to force the British out of Boston in 1776, but was defeated and almost captured later that year when he lost New York City. After crossing the Delaware River in the dead of winter, he defeated the British in two battles, retook New Jersey and restored momentum to the Patriot cause.
</p>

<p>Because of his strategy, Revolutionary forces captured two major British armies at Saratoga in 1777 and Yorktown in 1781. Historians laud Washington for his selection and supervision of his generals, encouragement of morale and ability to hold together the army, coordination with the state governors and state militia units, relations with Congress and attention to supplies, logistics, and training. In battle, however, Washington was repeatedly outmaneuvered by British generals with larger armies. After victory had been finalized in 1783, Washington resigned as Commander-in-chief rather than seize power, proving his opposition to dictatorship and his commitment to American republicanism.
</p>

<h2 class="header">French and Indian War (1754–1758)</h2>

<p>In 1753, the French began expanding their military control into the "Ohio 
Country", a territory also claimed by the British colonies of Virginia and 
Pennsylvania. These competing claims led to a war in the colonies called the 
French and Indian War (1754–62), and contributed to the start of the global 
Seven Years' War (1756–63). Washington was at the center of its beginning. The 
Ohio Company was one vehicle through which British investors planned to expand 
into the territory, opening new settlements and building trading posts for the 
Indian trade.</p>

<p>
Governor Dinwiddie received orders from the British government to warn the 
French of British claims, and sent Major Washington in late 1753 to deliver a 
letter informing the French of those claims and asking them to leave. Washington 
also met with Tanacharison (also called "Half-King") and other Iroquois leaders 
allied to Virginia at Logstown to secure their support in case of conflict with 
the French; Washington and Tanacharison became friends and allies. Washington 
delivered the letter to the local French commander, who politely refused to 
leave.
</p>

<p>
Governor Dinwiddie sent Washington back to the Ohio Country to protect an Ohio Company group building a fort at present-day Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania but before he reached the area, a French force drove out the company's crew and began construction of Fort Duquesne. A small detachment of French troops led by Joseph Coulon de Jumonville, was discovered by Tanacharison and a few warriors east of present-day Uniontown, Pennsylvania. Along with their Mingo allies, Washington and some of his militia unit then ambushed the French. What exactly happened during and after the battle is a matter of some controversy, but the immediate outcome was that Jumonville was injured in the initial attack and then was killed - whether tomahawked by Tanacharison in cold blood or somehow shot by another onlooker with a musket as the injured man sat with Washington is not completely clear.
</p>

<p>
The French responded by attacking and capturing Washington at Fort Necessity in 
July 1754. However, he was allowed to return with his troops to Virginia. 
Historian Joseph Ellis concludes that the episode demonstrated Washington's 
bravery, initiative, inexperience and impetuosity. These events had international consequences; the French accused Washington of assassinating Jumonville, who they claimed was on a diplomatic mission. Both France and Great Britain were ready to fight for control of the region and both sent troops to North America in 1755; war was formally declared in 1756.
</p>


<h2 class="header">Between the wars: Mount Vernon (1759–1774)</h2>

<p>
On January 6, 1759, Washington married the wealthy widow Martha Dandridge 
Custis, then 28 years old. Surviving letters suggest that he may have been in 
love at the time with Sally Fairfax, the wife of a friend. Nevertheless, George 
and Martha made a compatible marriage, because Martha was intelligent, gracious, 
and experienced in managing a planter's estate.</p>

<p>
Together the two raised her two children from her previous marriage, John Parke 
Custis and Martha Parke Custis; later the Washingtons raised two of Mrs. 
Washington's grandchildren, Eleanor Parke Custis and George Washington Parke 
Custis. George and Martha never had any children together – his earlier bout 
with smallpox in 1751 may have made him sterile. The newlywed couple moved to Mount Vernon, near Alexandria, where he took up the life of a planter and political figure.
</p>

<p>
Washington's marriage to Martha greatly increased his property holdings and social standing, and made him one of Virginia's wealthiest men. He acquired one-third of the 18,000-acre (73 km2) Custis estate upon his marriage, worth approximately $100,000, and managed the remainder on behalf of Martha's children, for whom he sincerely cared.
</p>

<p>
In 1754, Lieutenant Governor Dinwiddie had promised land bounties to the soldiers and officers who volunteered to serve during the French and Indian War. 
Governor Norborne Berkeley finally fulfilled Dinwiddie's promise in 1769–1770, 
with Washington subsequently receiving title to 23,200 acres (94 km2) near where 
the Kanawha River flows into the Ohio River, in what is now western West 
Virginia. He also frequently bought additional land in his own name. By 1775, 
Washington had doubled the size of Mount Vernon to 6,500 acres (26 km2), and had 
increased its slave population to over 100. As a respected military hero and 
large landowner, he held local office and was elected to the Virginia provincial 
legislature, the House of Burgesses, beginning in 1758.
</p>

<p>
Washington lived an aristocratic lifestyle—fox hunting was a favorite leisure activity. He also enjoyed going to dances and parties, in addition to the theater, races, and cockfights. Washington also was known to play cards, backgammon, and billiards. Like most Virginia planters, he imported luxuries and other goods from England and paid for them by exporting his tobacco crop.
</p>

<h2 class="header">American Revolution (1775–1783)</h2>

<p>
ByBy the Treaty of Paris (signed that September), Great Britain recognized the 
independence of the United States. Washington disbanded his army and, on 
November 2, gave an eloquent farewell address to his soldiers.</p>

<p>
On November 25, the British evacuated New York City, and Washington and the governor took possession. At Fraunces Tavern on December 4, Washington formally bade his officers farewell and on December 23, 1783, he resigned his commission as commander-in-chief. Historian Gordon Wood concludes that the greatest act in his life was his resignation as commander of the armies—an act that stunned aristocratic Europe. King George III called Washington "the greatest character of the age" because of this.
</p>

<h2 class="header">United States Constitution</h2>

<p>
WaWashington's retirement to Mount Vernon was short-lived. He made an exploratory trip to the western frontier in 1784, was persuaded to attend the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia in the summer of 1787, and was unanimously elected president of the Convention. He participated little in the debates (though he did vote for or against the various articles), but his high prestige maintained collegiality and kept the delegates at their labors. The delegates designed the presidency with Washington in mind, and allowed him to define the office once elected. After the Convention, his support convinced many to vote for ratification; the new Constitution was ratified by all thirteen states.
</p>


<h2 class="header">Presidency(1789-1797)</h2>

<p>
ThThe Electoral College elected Washington unanimously as the first president in 1789, 
and again in the 1792 election; he remains the only president to have received 
100 percent of the electoral votes. John Adams, who received the next highest 
vote total, was elected Vice President. At his inauguration, Washington took the 
oath of office as the first President of the United States of America on April 
30, 1789, on the balcony of Federal Hall in New York City.
</p>

<p>
The 1st United States Congress voted to pay Washington a salary of $25,000 a year—a large sum in 1789. Washington, already wealthy, declined the salary, since he valued his image as a selfless public servant. At the urging of Congress, however, he ultimately accepted the payment, to avoid setting a precedent whereby the presidency would be perceived as limited only to independently wealthy individuals who could serve without any salary. The president, aware that everything he did set a precedent, attended carefully to the pomp and ceremony of office, making sure that the titles and trappings were suitably republican and never emulated European royal courts. To that end, he preferred the title "Mr. President" to the more majestic names suggested.
</p>

<p>
Washington proved an able administrator. An excellent delegator and judge of talent and character, he talked regularly with department heads and listened to their advice before making a final decision.&nbsp; In handling routine tasks, he was "systematic, orderly, energetic, solicitous of the opinion of others ... but decisive, intent upon general goals and the consistency of particular actions withthem."Washington reluctantly served a second term. He refused to run for a third, establishing the customary policy of a maximum of two terms for a president.
</p>

<h2 class="header">Retirement (1797–1799)</h2>

<p>
AfAfter retiring from the presidency in March 1797, Washington returned to Mount Vernon with a profound sense of relief. He devoted much time to his plantations and other business interests, including his distillery which produced its first batch of spirits in February 1797. As Chernow (2010) explains, his plantation operations were at best marginally profitable. The lands out west yielded little income because they were under attack by Indians and the squatters living there refused to pay him rent. Most Americans assumed he was rich because of the well-known "glorified façade of wealth and grandeur" at Mount Vernon. Historians estimate his estate was worth about $1 million in 1799 dollars, equivalent to about $18 million in 2009 purchasing power.
</p>

<p>
By 1798, relations with France had deteriorated to the point that war seemed imminent, and on July 4, 1798, President Adams offered Washington a commission as lieutenant general and Commander-in-chief of the armies raised or to be raised for service in a prospective war. He reluctantly accepted, and served as the senior officer of the United States Army between July 13, 1798, and December 14, 1799. He participated in the planning for a Provisional Army to meet any emergency that might arise, but avoided involvement in details as much as possible; he delegated most of the work, including leadership of the army, to Hamilton.
p>

<h2 class="header">Death</h2>

<p>
On Thursday, December 12, 1799, Washington spent several hours inspecting his plantation on horseback, in snow, hail, and freezing rain—later that evening eating his supper without changing from his wet clothes. That Friday he awoke with a severe sore throat (either quinsy or acute epiglottitis) and became increasingly hoarse as the day progressed. Sometime around 3 a.m. that Saturday, he awoke his wife and said he felt ill. Following common medical practice at the time, he was bled—initially by an employee and later again by physicians.
</p>

<p>
Washington died at home around 10 p.m. on Saturday, December 14, 1799, aged 67. The last words in his diary were "'Tis well."
