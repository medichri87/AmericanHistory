        <h3 class="info_headings">American Revolution Begins</h3>
        <p>The Revolutionary War lasted from 1775-1783. 
        This fight between Great Britain and its thirteen colonies was the result of years of growing conflict. 
        After the French and Indian War that occurred between 1754-1763, the British government 
        began requiring the colonies to pay higher taxes. Over time, protests and conflict led to a tightening of control by the Mother Country. 
        Beginning with the fighting at Lexington and Concord in April 1775, open warfare broke out. </p>
        
        <h3 class="info_headings">Major events that lead to the War</h3>
        

	<ol>
        <li><u>Proclamation of 1763</u> - This prohibited settlement beyond the Appalachian Mountains. While Britain did not intend to harm the colonists, many colonists took offense at this order. </li>
        <br/>
        <li><u>1764 Sugar Act</u> - This act raised revenue by increasing duties on sugar imported from the West Indies.</li><br/>
        <li><u>1764 Currency Act</u> - Parliament argued that colonial currency had caused a devaluation harmful to British trade. They banned American assemblies from issuing paper bills or bills of credit.</li><br/>
        <li><u>1765 Quartering Act</u> - Britain ordered that colonists were to house and feed British soldiers if necessary.</li><br/>
        <li><u>1765 Stamp Act</u> - This required tax stamps on many items and documents including playing cards, newspapers, and marriage licenses. Prime Minister George Grenville stated that this direct tax was intended for the colonies to pay for defense. Previous taxes imposed by Britain had been indirect, or hidden.</li><br/>
        <li><u>1767 Townshend Acts</u> - These taxes were imposed to help make the colonial officials independent of the colonists and included duties on glass, paper, and tea. Smugglers increased their activities to avoid the tax leading to more troops in Boston.</li><br/>
        <li><u>Boston Massacre</u> - The colonists and British soldiers openly clashed in Boston. This event was used as an example of British cruelty despite questions about how it actually occurred.</li><br/>
        <li><u>1773 Tea Act</u> - To assist the failing British East India Company, the Company was given a monopoly to trade tea in America.</li><br/>
        <li><u>1773 Boston Tea Party</u> - A group of colonists disguised as Indians dumped tea overboard from three ships in Boston Harbor.</li><br/>
        <li><u>1774 Intolerable Acts</u> - These were passed in response to the Boston Tea Party and placed restrictions on the colonists including outlawing town meetings and the closing of Boston Harbor.</li><br/>
        <li><u>Lexington and Concord</u> - In April, British troops were ordered to Lexington and Concord to seize stores of colonial gunpowder and to capture Samuel Adams and John Hancock. At Lexington, open conflict occurred and eight Americans were killed. At Concord, the British troops were forced to retreat with the loss of 70 men. This was the first instance of open warfare.</li><br/>

        <h3 class="info_headings">Battle of Bunker Hill</h3>
        <p>Within two months after the Battles of Lexington and Concord (April 19, 1775), more than 15,000 troops from Massachusetts, Connecticut, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island had assembled in the vicinity of Boston to confront the British army of 5,000 or more stationed there. General Artemas Ward, commander in chief of the Massachusetts troops, served as the senior New England officer. There were two obvious points from which Boston was vulnerable to artillery fire: Dorchester Heights, and two high hills, Bunker's and Breed's, in Charlestown, about a quarter of a mile across the Charles River from the north shore of Boston. By the middle of June, hearing that British general Thomas Gage was about to occupy Dorchester Heights, the colonists decided to fortify the hills. By the time they were discovered, Colonel William Prescott and his men had completed a redoubt atop Breed's Hill (which was an indefensible decision in the eyes of many historians, since Breed's Hill was lower and less impregnable than Bunker Hill). Despite a cannonade from British men-of-war in the harbour and from a battery across the river in north Boston, the colonists continued to strengthen their position.</p>

		<p>Gage then dispatched about 2,300 troops under Major General William Howe against Prescott. 
		Landing without opposition under artillery protection, the British were stopped by heavy fire from the colonial troops barricaded 
		behind rail fences that had been stuffed with grass, hay, and brush. On the second or third advance, however, the attackers carried
		 the redoubt and forced the surviving defenders, mostly exhausted and weaponless, to flee. Casualties numbered more than 1,000 British
		  and about 450 American soldiers.</p>
		  
		<p>If the British had followed this victory with an attack on Dorchester Heights to the south of Boston, 
		it might have been worth the heavy cost. But, presumably because of their severe losses and the fighting spirit displayed 
		by the rebels, the British commanders abandoned or indefinitely postponed such a plan.<br/> Consequently, after General George
		 Washington, who took colonial command two weeks later, had collected enough heavy guns and ammunition to threaten Boston, 
		 he was able in March 1776 to seize and fortify Dorchester Heights and compel the British to evacuate Boston and the harbour.
		  Also, the heavy losses inflicted on the British in the Battle of Bunker Hill bolstered the Americans' confidence and showed
		   that the relatively inexperienced colonists could indeed fight on par with the mighty redcoats of the British Army. </p>
        
        <h3 class="info_headings">Battle of Trenton and Princeton</h3>
        <p >After the capture of Fort Washington on Manhattan Island in November 1776, the British general Sir William Howe 
        forced the Americans to retreat through New Jersey and across the Delaware River into Pennsylvania. Howe then went into winter 
        quarters, leaving the Hessian colonel Johann Rall at Trenton with about 1,400 men.
		Although Washington's Continental Army was discouraged by the year's disasters, its morale was not crushed, and it now numbered 
		6,000 effectives. Ascertaining that the Hessians were virtually unsupported, Washington determined to attempt their capture. 
		Despite the ice floes in the Delaware, Washington crossed the river on December 25 and surprised the enemy, the next day 
		capturing more than 900 men. Four days later he occupied Trenton. Hearing of Washington's move, Lord Cornwallis confronted the 
		Continentals east of the city with about 7,000 troops on January 2, 1777, driving them back.</p> 
		<p >Unable to find boats for an escape,
		 Washington called a council of war that confirmed his bold plan to break camp quietly that night and take a byroad to Princeton. 
		 The maneuver succeeded, and three British regiments that met him there on January 3 were all driven back or retreated. As a result,
		  Washington continued his march to Morristown, New Jersey, where he flanked British communications with New York. Cornwallis 
		  retired to New Brunswick. Besides succeeding in breaking through Howe's lines, Washington had placed himself in an advantageous
		   position for recruiting his army and maintaining a strong defensive in the next campaign.
		The effect of these early American victories in the battles of Trenton and Princeton was marked. Following close upon a series of
		 defeats, they put new life into the American cause and renewed confidence in Washington as commander of the Revolutionary Army.</p>
        
        <h3 class="info_headings">Battle of Saratoga</h3>
        <p >After capturing Fort Ticonderoga with almost laughable ease, the British army, led by overconfident General John Burgoyne, crawled south at a tortoise pace, giving the rattled Americans time to regroup under Horatio Gates. To support him, General George Washington sent Benedict Arnold, his best infantry commander; Colonel Daniel Morgan and his crack regiment of Virginia riflemen; and two brigades of Continentals from the Hudson Highlands. They raised Gates's strength to about sixty-five hundred men. Equally important was Colonel Thaddeus Kosciusko, the Polish engineer, who built excellent field fortifications on Bemis Heights overlooking the Hudson River.
		<p >On September 19, Burgoyne attacked. The fiery Arnold prodded Gates out of his defensive mentality, winning permission to lead Morgan's men and Henry Dearborn's light infantry into the woods to block a British flanking column. For most of the afternoon, a furious struggle raged around and across a clearing called Freeman's Farm; Arnold poured in fresh regiments until the jittery Gates broke off the action, leaving the battered British in possession of the ground. After fortifying his camp and waiting in vain for reinforcements from New York, Burgoyne attempted another assault on October 7. Ignoring orders from the jealous Gates to remain in his quarters, Arnold joined the fighting and led an attack that captured key strong points, forcing the British to retreat to Saratoga (modern Schuylerville). There, surrounded by a belated outpouring of militia, Burgoyne surrendered ten days later.</p></p>
        
        <h3 class="info_headings">Trials of Valley Forge</h3>
        <p >Following the American failures at the battles of Brandywine and Germantown during the American Revolution, General George Washington led 11,000 troops to take up winter quarters at Valley Forge in Pennsylvania. Located on the west bank of the Schuylkill River, 22 miles northwest of Philadelphia--which at the time was occupied by the British--Valley Forge was considered easily defensible, and was strategically located on leading trade routes and near farm supplies. Washington's army campted at Valley Forge from December 19, 1777 to June 19, 1778, a period in which morale and military discipline triumphed over severe hardship.</p>
        
        
        <h3 class="info_headings">Battle of Yorktown</h3>
        <p >When Charles, Lord Cornwallis, British commander in the South during the American Revolutionary War, retreated to the Yorktown peninsula in June 1781 to rest and reequip his battered army, George Washington was outside New York, preparing an assault on that British-held city with the help of the four-thousand-man French expeditionary force commanded by the count of Rochambeau.
		Then came news that the thirty-four-ship French West Indies battle fleet was heading for Virginia with three thousand infantry. (Rochambeau had urged the French admiral, de Grasse, to undertake this gamble.) Plans for New York were abandoned, and Washington executed a swift concentration of every available soldier before the little tobacco port on the Chesapeake.

 		<p >A trapped Cornwallis asked the British fleet and army in New York for help. The fleet sortied to clash with French ships of the line off the Virginia Capes in one of the most important least-known naval battles of history. The outnumbered British admiral, Thomas Graves, adhered rigidly to the conservative "Fighting Instructions," which prescribed a strict line of battle formation aimed at limiting losses. De Grasse battered several British ships in a two-and-a-half-hour clash, and Graves, after two more days of fruitless maneuvers for advantage, abandoned Cornwallis and returned to New York.
		Meanwhile, a smaller French squadron under Admiral Barras slipped into the Chesapeake, carrying the French army's siege artillery. Trapped behind hastily constructed redoubts, without cannon heavy enough to match the French big guns, Cornwallis's army crumbled under night and day bombardment. On October 14, two key redoubts were carried in a night assault. Three days later, Cornwallis surrendered.</p>
 		</p>    
    
        <h3 class="info_headings">End of the war - British surrender</h3>
        <p >The talks began in April 1782, after the American-French victory at Yorktown led to the toppling of Lord North's 
        Tory government and the naming of a Whig, Lord Rockingham, as prime minister and Lord Shelburne as foreign minister. 
        The Continental Congress named a five-member commission to negotiate a treaty--John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, John Jay, Thomas Jefferson, and Henry Laurens. Laurens, however, was captured by a British warship and held in the Tower of London until the end of the war, and Jefferson did not leave the United States in time to take part in the negotiations. Thus, they were conducted by Adams, Franklin, and Jay. The preliminary articles of peace were signed by Adams, Franklin, Jay, and Henry Laurens for the United States and Richard Oswald for Great Britain on November 30, 1782. 
        The final treaty was signed on September 3, 1783, and ratified by the Continental Congress early in 1784.</p>

        <h3 class="info_headings">Legacy</h3>
        <p >Consider all of America's wars, the American Revolution is the most significant. The combined efforts of the 13 colonies and the militias therein were able to cast off the British government and overcome a military that was much better equipped and better supplied. The colonists had long suffered the rule of King George III, but were no longer able to remain passive. On July 4, 1776 after "a long train of abuses", the people saw fit to pursue another course. We declared our independence and formed a government based on the 'consent of the governed', dedicated to the proposition that <i>"all men are created equal, endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness"</i>.<br/>  That passage has often been used to promote the rights of marginalized people throughout the world, and came to represent a moral standard for which the United States would strive. That same government has faced many challenges since that time. It has for over 235 years progressed in a way not quite seen in human history. We still have the same government today, guided largely by these same principles and the same form of government. It has served us well thus far, and hopefully will continue in this regard. </p>
