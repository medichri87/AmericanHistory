<h3 class = "info_headings">Childhood</h3>
<p class="p_info">
Abraham Lincoln's Childhood and Education:

Lincoln was born in Hardin County, Kentucky on February 12, 1809. He moved to Indiana in 1816 and lived there the rest of his youth. His mother died when he was nine but he was very close to his stepmother who urged him to read. Lincoln himself stated that he had about one year of formal education. However, he was taught by many different individuals. He loved to read and learn from any books he could get his hands on. 
</p>


<h3 class = "info_headings">Family</h3>
<p class="family">Family Ties:

Father: Thomas Lincoln - farmer and carpenter<br/>
Mother: Nancy Hanks - died when Lincoln was nine. His stepmother, Sarah Bush Johnston, was very close to him.<br/>
Siblings: Sarah Grigsby was the only sibling to live to maturity.<br/>
Wife: Mary Todd - grew up in relative wealth. Four of her siblings fought for the South. She was considered mentally unbalanced.<br/>
Children: Robert Todd - lawyer and diplomat; William Wallace - the only president's child to die in the White House, and Thomas "Tad" - died at 18.</p>

<h3 class = "info_headings">Military Career</h3>
<p class="p_info">In 1832, Lincoln enlisted to fight in the Black Hawk War. He was quickly elected to be the captain of a company of volunteers. His company joined regulars under Colonel Zachary Taylor. He only served 30 days in this capacity and then signed on as a private in the mounted Rangers. He then joined the Independent Spy Corps. He saw no real action during his short stint in the military.</p>

<h3 class = "info_headings">Before the Presidency</h3>
<p class="p_info">Lincoln worked as a clerk before joining the military. He ran for the state legislature and lost in 1832. He was appointed as Postmaster of New Salem by Andrew Jackson (1833-36). He was elected as a Whig to the Illinois legislature (1834-1842). He studied law and was admitted to the bar in 1836. Lincoln served as a US Representative (1847-49). He was elected to the state legislature in 1854 but resigned to run for the US Senate. He gave his famous "house divided" speech after being nominated.</p>

<h3 class = "info_headings">Lincoln-Douglas Debates</h3>
<p class="p_info">
Lincoln debated his opponent, Stephen Douglas, seven times in what became known as the Lincoln-Douglas Debates. While they agreed on many issues, they disagreed over the morality of slavery. Lincoln did not believe that slavery should spread any further but Douglas argued for popular sovereignty. Lincoln explained that while he was not asking for equality, he believed African-Americans should get the rights granted in the Declaration of Independence: life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Lincoln lost the state election to Douglas. </p>

<h3 class = "info_headings">Bid for the Presidency - 1860</h3>
<p class="p_info">Lincoln was nominated for the presidency by the Republican Party with Hannibal Hamlin as his running mate. He ran on a platform denouncing disunion and calling for an end to slavery in the territories. The Democrats were divided with Stephen Douglas representing the Democrats and John Breckinridge the National (Southern) Democrats. John Bell ran for the Constitutional Union Party which basically took votes from Douglas. In the end, Lincoln won 40% of the popular vote and 180 of the 303 electors.
En route to his inauguration by train, Lincoln addressed crowds and legislatures across the North. The president-elect then evaded possible assassins in Baltimore, who were uncovered by Lincoln's head of security, Allan Pinkerton. On February 23, 1861, he arrived in disguise in Washington, D.C., which was placed under substantial military guard. <br/>
Lincoln directed his inaugural address to the South, proclaiming once again that he had no intention, or inclination, to abolish slavery in the Southern states:
<blockquote style="text-align:center">"Apprehension seems to exist among the people of the Southern States that by the accession of a Republican Administration their property and their peace and personal security are to be endangered. There has never been any reasonable cause for such apprehension. Indeed, the most ample evidence to the contrary has all the while existed and been open to their inspection. It is found in nearly all the published speeches of him who now addresses you. I do but quote from one of those speeches when I declare that "I have no purpose, directly or indirectly, to interfere with the institution of slavery in the States where it exists. I believe I have no lawful right to do so, and I have no inclination to do so."
<br/>—First inaugural address, 4 March 1861</blockquote>

<h3 class="info_headings">The Civil War</h3>
<p class="p_info">On April 12, 1861, Confederate forces fired on Union troops at Fort Sumter, setting off the War Between the States. 
After the fall of Fort Sumter, Lincoln realized the importance of taking immediate executive control of the war and making an 
overall strategy to put down the rebellion. Lincoln encountered an unprecedented political and military crisis, and he responded
 as commander-in-chief, using unprecedented powers. He expanded his war powers, and imposed a blockade on all the Confederate 
 shipping ports, disbursed funds before appropriation by Congress, and after suspending habeas corpus, arrested and imprisoned 
 thousands of suspected Confederate sympathizers. Lincoln was supported by Congress and the northern public for these actions.
The Confederacy lacked reinforcements, so Lee's army shrank with every battle, forcing it back to trenches outside Petersburg, 
Virginia, where Grant began a siege. Lincoln then made an extended visit to Grant's headquarters at City Point, Virginia. This 
allowed the president to confer in person with Grant and William Tecumseh Sherman about the hostilities, as Sherman coincidentally 
managed a hasty visit to Grant from his position in North Carolina. Lincoln and the Republican party mobilized support for the draft 
throughout the North, and replaced his losses. For more information on the Civil War, <a target="_blank" href="../wars/civilwar.html">click here.</a></p>

<p class="p_info">
Lincoln authorized Grant to target the Confederate infrastructure—such as plantations, railroads, and bridges—hoping to destroy
 the South's morale and weaken its economic ability to continue fighting. Grant's move to Petersburg resulted in the obstruction
  of three railroads between Richmond and the South. This strategy allowed Generals Sherman and Philip Sheridan to destroy plantations
   and towns in Virginia's Shenandoah Valley. The damage caused by Sherman's March to the Sea through Georgia in 1864 was limited 
   to a 60-mile (97 km) swath but neither Lincoln nor his commanders saw destruction as the main goal, but rather defeat of the Confederate armies. 
Confederate general Jubal Anderson Early began a series of assaults in the North that threatened the Capital. During his raid on 
Washington, D.C. in 1864, Lincoln was watching the combat from an exposed position; 
Captain Oliver Wendell Holmes shouted at him, "Get down, you damn fool, before you get shot!" 
After repeated calls on Grant to defend Washington, Sheridan was appointed and the threat from Early was dispatched.</p>


<p class="p_info">
As Grant continued to wear down Lee's forces, efforts to discuss peace began. Confederate Vice President Stephens led a group 
to meet with Lincoln, Seward, and others at Hampton Roads. Lincoln refused to allow any negotiation with the Confederacy as a coequal; 
his sole objective was an agreement to end the fighting and the meetings produced no results. On April 1, 1865, Grant successfully 
outflanked Lee's forces in the Battle of Five Forks and nearly encircled Petersburg, and the Confederate government evacuated Richmond. 
Days later, when that city fell, Lincoln visited the vanquished Confederate capital; as he walked through the city, white Southerners 
were stone-faced, but freedmen greeted him as a hero. On April 9, Lee surrendered to Grant at Appomattox and the war was effectively 
over.</p>


<h3 class="info_headings">Emancipation Proclamation</h3>
<p class="p_info">The Emancipation Proclamation, issued on September 22, 1862, and put into effect on January 1, 1863, declared free the slaves in ten states not then under Union control, with exemptions specified for areas already under Union control in two states. Once the abolition of slavery in the rebel states became a military objective, as Union armies advanced south, more slaves were liberated until over three million of them in Confederate territory were freed. Lincoln's comment on the signing of the Proclamation was: "I never, in my life, felt more certain that I was doing right, than I do in signing this paper.</p>

<h3 class = "info_headings">Assassination</h3>
<p class="p_info">On April 14, 1865, Lincoln was assassinated while attending a play at Ford's Theater in Washington, D.C. Actor John Wilkes Booth shot him in the back of the head before jumping onto the stage and escaping to Maryland. Lincoln died on April 15th.

On April 26th, Booth was found hiding in a barn which was set on fire. He was then shot and killed. Eight conspirators were punished for their roles. </p>

<h3 class = "info_headings">Significance</h3>
<p class="p_info">Abraham Lincoln is considered by many scholars to have been the best President. He is credited with holding the Union together and leading the North to victory in the Civil War. Further, his actions and beliefs led to the emancipation of African-Americans from the bonds of slavery.</p>
